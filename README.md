# SECR1013 Digital-Logic 1Ô∏è‚É£0Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£
Studying digital logic has been a transformative journey that greatly enhanced my understanding of how computers and digital systems function at a fundamental level. One of the most impactful aspects was grasping how binary systems operate. Concepts such as Boolean algebra, truth tables, and logical gates (1Ô∏è‚É£ & 0Ô∏è‚É£) revealed how computers perform calculations and make decisions using only 0s and 1s. This provided me with a clear connection between abstract mathematical theories and their real-world applications in technology. I particularly enjoyed the challenge of designing and analyzing both combinational and sequential circuits. Learning about multiplexers, decoders, flip-flops, and counters pushed me to think both critically and creatively, helping me develop problem-solving skills. Through this course, I also refined my analytical abilities. Digital logic demands precision and focus, as even small errors can lead to major issues in circuit design or functionality. Overcoming these obstacles taught me the value of perseverance and a careful, methodical approach. Ultimately, this course not only equipped me with essential technical knowledge but also deepened my appreciation for the engineering behind digital systems, laying a solid foundation for my future studies in computer scienceüñ•Ô∏èüñ•Ô∏èüñ•Ô∏è.
